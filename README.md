# Passbook-Generator
A material design tool to generate structured xml used to create an Apple/Google passbook file.

## API Reference

This tool uses Angular and the Google Maps Geocoding API to let users fill out relevant information to generate a Passbook Pass that can be used on mobile devices. A preview is to the right of the fields to give users a live view of what their changes are doing. This application also allows for importing existing passbook definitions to update accordingly and then export.
